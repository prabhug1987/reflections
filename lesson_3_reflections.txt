When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I will create a remote repository only when there are multiple user can check out and commit their code or changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Suppose if It is a automatic update then there can conflict between the file in local and remote.
